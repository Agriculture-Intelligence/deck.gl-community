# Overview

:::danger
The deck.gl-community repo is specifically set up to collect useful code that no longer has dedicated maintainers. This means that there is often no one who can respond quickly to issues. The vis.gl / Open Visualization team members who try to keep this running can only put a few hours into it every now and then. It is important to understand this limitation. If you are expect timely fixes, and you are not able to contribute them yourself, do not use any deck.gl-community module.
